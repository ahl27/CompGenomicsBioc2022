## Coevolutionary Analysis

At this point, we've learned how to generate gene trees for a set of COGs.
We're now ready to look for signals of coevolution, which imply functional associations.
These methods are implemented via the `ProtWeaver` class in `SynExtend`, which 
includes many commonly used methods for detecting coevolutionary patterns.
While the previous step only generated a few gene trees, I've included an 
`RData` file with the results if we had generated gene trees for all COGs in the
dataset.

Generating a `ProtWeaver` object from this is simple:
```{r results='hide', fig.keep='all'}
datafile <- system.file('extdata', 'treesFromCOGs.RData', 
                        package='CompGenomicsBioc2022')
load(datafile, verbose=TRUE)

pw <- ProtWeaver(treesFromCOGs[1:25])
```

```{r}
print(pw)
```
The `ProtWeaver` constuctor automatically detects the type of data you have and 
adjusts available predictors accordingly. While it functions best with a list
of dendrograms for each COG, it can also run with simple presence/absence patterns.
See the documentation file for `ProtWeaver` for more information on this functionality.

We're now ready to make predictions. Predicting functional associations is done
with the `predict.ProtWeaver` S3 method. Let's examine possible functional associations 
between the first 100 COGs we have.

```{r results='hide'}
preds <- predict(pw)
```

```{r}
print(preds)
```
## Viewing our results

Notice that `preds` is a `ProtWeb` object. This is just a simple S3 class with a 
pretty print method wrapping a matrix of pairwise association scores. We can get
the raw data with `GetProtWebData()`:

```{r}
GetProtWebData(preds)
```

The `ProtWeb` class will be updated next release cycle to include more methods, 
including a custom plotting function. The current `plot.ProtWeb` S3 method 
implements a force-directed embedding of the pairwise scores, but it's a
big work-in-progress. Stay tuned for the next release cycle for more functionality
regarding `ProtWeb`.

## Methods Implemented in ProtWeaver

By default, `predict.ProtWeaver` makes an ensemble prediction using as many individual
models as it can run with the data provided. However, users are free to use any of 
the individual models without the ensemble predictor. The methods implemented are 
the following:

```{r results='hide'}
# Phylogenetic Profiling Methods:
  ## P/A = Presence/Absence Profiles
Jaccard <- predict(pw, method='Jaccard') # Jaccard distance of P/A
Hamming <- predict(pw, method='Hamming') # Hamming distance of P/A
MutualInf <- predict(pw, method='MutualInformation') # MutualInformation of P/A
ProfDCA <- predict(pw, method='ProfDCA') # Direct Coupling Analysis of P/A
Behdenna <- predict(pw, method='Behdenna', mySpeciesTree=exSpeciesTree)
  # Correlation of gain/loss events on phylogeny, requires Species Tree

# Co-localization Methods:
Colocalization <- predict(pw, method='Coloc') # Co-localization analysis

# Distance Matrix Methods:
MirrorTree <- predict(pw, method='MirrorTree') # MirrorTree analysis
ContextTree <- predict(pw, method='ContextTree') # ContextTree analysis

# Residue Methods: (ONLY AVAILABLE IN DEV VERSION)
#ResidueMI <- predict(pw, method='ResidueMI') # MutualInf of residues
#DendroMI <- predict(pw, method='DendroMI') # MutualInf of changes on phylogeny
```

## Thank you!

If you've made it through this entire tutorial, thank you for following along!
I hope this series was informative and useful to your analyses. All code showcased
here is actively being worked on by members of our lab, especially the `ProtWeaver`
and `ProtWeb` functionalities. If you have any comments, suggestions, or feature requests
for `ProtWeaver`, `ProtWeb`, or this tutorial, please feel free to either email me at

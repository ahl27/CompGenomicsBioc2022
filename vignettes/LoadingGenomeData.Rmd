## Reading in Sequencing Data

In order to work with sequencing data, we first have to get it into R in a format
that allows us to work with it. The most commonly used format for genomic data is
the `XString` and `XStringSet` classes, which are available through the `Biostrings`
package.

`XStrings` come in 4 distinct flavors, depending on the characters allowed:

- `DNAString`, for DNA data (ATGC, plus gaps and ambiguity codes)
- `RNAString`, for RNA data (AUGC, plus gaps and ambiguity codes)
- `AAString`, for amino acid data (20 amino acids plus ambiguity codes, U, O, and unknown/gaps)
- `BString`, for any combination of any letters

When `XString` objects of the same type are combined, they become an `XStringSet`. 
This provides an easy way to store and work with genomics data. Below is an
example of manually creating an `XStringSet`:
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(DECIPHER) # Auto-imports Biostrings
```

```{r}

sequences <- c('AGACT',
               'AGACG',
               'TCATT',
               'TGCTG',
               'AGCTG')

sequenceSet <- DNAStringSet(sequences)
sequenceSet
```

Manually typing in sequences obviously isn't a great system. Most sequencing data 
are downloadable as `.fasta` or `.fastq` files, so let's look at a more realistic
use-case that reads in a data from a `.fasta`. We're going to be using an example
set of 50 complete *Streptomyces* genomes obtained from [NCBI GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/data-hub/genome/?taxon=1883&reference_only=true&assembly_level=1%3A3).
If you can't find the FASTA file, you can download it on the [Setup page](https://www.ahl27.com/CompGenomicsBioc2022/articles/Setup.html).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
exampledata <- system.file('extdata', 'EX_Strepto_COG.fasta', 
                            package='CompGenomicsBioc2022')

exStringSet <- readDNAStringSet(exampledata, format="fasta")
exStringSet <- exStringSet[1:50]
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# This datafile is available from materials on the Setup page
exampledata <- load('EX_Strepto_COG.fasta')

# note that we can also use format='fastq' for FASTQ datasets
exStringSet <- readDNAStringSet(exampledata, format="fasta")
```
Success! Now we have a large example dataset to work with.

If we wanted to visualize these sequences, we can open them in a web browser
using `BrowseSeqs()` from `DECIPHER`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BrowseSeqs(exStringSet)
```

## Aligning Sequences

Now that we have some sequences, let's explore some of the ways we can manipulate
them. A complete demo of `Biostrings` is outside the scope of this workshop, so
we'll just focus on functionality added via `DECIPHER`. A common analysis in 
bioinformatics is aligning sequences. This is easily achievable with either the 
`AlignSeqs()` function or the `AlignTranslation()` functions from `DECIPHER`. 
`AlignTranslation()` aligns sequences based on their translated amino acid sequences, 
and is significantly more accurate for coding sequences. This code block will
also use `RemoveGaps()` from `DECIPHER` to remove gaps that are shared by all
sequences, in an effort to make the R printout a little more informative. 

```{r}
# Align the sequences
aliNoTranslate <- AlignSeqs(exStringSet, verbose=FALSE)

# Aligning using translated amino acid sequences
aliTranslate <- AlignTranslation(exStringSet, verbose=FALSE)
```

Alignments tend to start with a lot of gaps, and as a result viewing them through
R isn't always super informative.
As before, we can visualize this alignment in a much better way using `BrowseSeqs()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BrowseSeqs(aliTranslate)
```

<!-- ## Alignment-Free Analysis -->

<!-- Another common analysis is to look at syntenic hits between sequences without  -->
<!-- aligning them. The result allows us to easily visualize differences between  -->
<!-- two sequences without having to align them. Let's look at an example of finding -->
<!-- syntenic hits between the first 6 sequences in our set. -->

<!-- ```{r results='hide', fig.keep='all'} -->
<!-- to_select <- c(4,6,8,9) -->
<!-- synData <- exStringSet[to_select] -->
<!-- names(synData) <- as.character(to_select) -->
<!-- dbConn <- dbConnect(SQLite(), ":memory:") -->
<!-- Seqs2DB(synData, "XStringSet", dbConn, identifier=as.character(to_select)) -->

<!-- syn <- FindSynteny(dbConn, verbose=FALSE) -->
<!-- dbDisconnect(dbConn) -->

<!-- pairs(syn) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What are we looking at with this plot? Each plot compares two genomes, and each -->
<!-- dot is a syntenic hit between the two genomes. The X position of the dot is its -->
<!-- location on the first genome, and the Y position is its position on the second genome. -->
<!-- If we had identical genomes, we would expect to see a diagonal line $y=x$, indicating -->
<!-- that all bases occur at the same place in both genomes. Gaps indicate areas that  -->
<!-- do not match, and points off the diagonal indicate matching areas in different places on  -->
<!-- each genomes. -->

<!-- You may also notice that this example creates a SQLite table prior to running `FindSynteny()`. -->
<!-- `DECIPHER` is built around working with sequences via SQLite tables to allow for  -->
<!-- analysis at scale. When working with hundreds of thousands of genomes, we can't always -->
<!-- just store the files within memory on our computer. This won't be covered in this -->
<!-- tutorial, but advanced users can refer to the `DECIPHER` docs to find out more about -->
<!-- using database files. I've also included more information on these in the Function -->
<!-- Reference page for this section. -->

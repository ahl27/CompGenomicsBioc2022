Description: In the past decade, the number of sequenced proteins with unknown functions has grown exponentially while the number of 
             experimentally analyzed proteins has increased at a relatively constant rate. To assign functions to more proteins, many 
             in silico methods have been produced that predict protein function purely from gene sequence data. These methods rely on 
             a ‘guilt-by-association’ analysis to detect genes that are likely involved in common functional pathways. We have 
             developed two Bioconductor packages with many functions for comparative genomics. This workshop will focus on one 
             application of comparative genomics: predicting the functional association between proteins to formulate hypotheses about 
             the unknown role of new proteins. Along the way, we will cover several topics:
             - Finding and importing genomes into a sequence database with the DECIPHER package
             - Gene calling and annotation using the DECIPHER package
             - Identification of clusters of orthologous genes using the SynExtend package
             - Construction of alignments and phylogenetic trees using the new TreeLine function in the DECIPHER package
             - Prediction of functional associations using ProtWeaver in the SynExtend package
             The talk will highlight our newest functionality, ProtWeaver, which implements several methods commonly used in the literature 
             to prediction protein functional association. We will briefly show how each algorithm works, then apply them to a real set of 
             proteins of unknown function. This workshop will teach participants how to extract useful information from large biological 
             sequence data with comparative genomics and predict the function of uncharacterized proteins.
